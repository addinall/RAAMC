Perhaps not a\r\n    Rotary Telephone.\r\n    \r\n    At first I wrote a membership for to bolt onto the RAAMC existing\r\n    site, but as it turned out the existing site was pretty old and sad,\r\n    and constructed in some bizarre CMS system from Denmark!  So I said\r\n    I would give them a new web site out the the goodness of my heart!\r\n\r\n    Everything in this site is built responsive from the ground up,\r\n    the slider, the forms, image containers, movie containers.\r\n\r\n    Again, I looked at some WordPress themes thinking I could save\r\n    some effort, but as usual they were fucking awful, fat and hard to\r\n    use.  Fair dinkum, the CMS ststems on offer are very poor quality.\r\n    As soon as this site is done I am going to tie a copy of Chameleon\r\n    to it to manage the content.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

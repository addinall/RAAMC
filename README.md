  SYSTEM:     RAAMC Accociation new web pages 
  AUTHOR:     Mark Addinall

  SYNOPSIS:

    This page in all of it's manifistations is RESPONSIVE and FLUID.
    It will work on a PC, Fondleslab or telephone.  Perhaps not a
    Rotary Telephone.
    
    At first I wrote a membership for to bolt onto the RAAMC existing
    site, but as it turned out the existing site was pretty old and sad,
    and constructed in some bizarre CMS system from Denmark!  So I said
    I would give them a new web site out the the goodness of my heart!

    Everything in this site is built responsive from the ground up,
    the slider, the forms, image containers, movie containers.

    Again, I looked at some WordPress themes thinking I could save
    some effort, but as usual they were fucking awful, fat and hard to
    use.  Fair dinkum, the CMS ststems on offer are very poor quality.
    As soon as this site is done I am going to tie a copy of Chameleon
    to it to manage the content.
